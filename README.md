A Python library to interact with the [Sway](https://swaywm.org ) window manager via its IPC interface.

Features
-----------

*   Query the current layout tree of Sway.
*   Get information about views (windows), outputs, inputs, and seats.
*   Run Sway commands programmatically.
*   Subscribe to real-time events like workspace changes, view focus, output updates, and more.

Requirements
---------------

*   Python 3.6+
*   Running inside a **Sway session**


Installation
---------------
install from source:

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pysway.git 
    cd pysway
    pip install -e .

Usage Examples
-----------------

### Get the Current Layout Tree

    from pysway.ipc import SwayIPC
    
    sway = SwayIPC()
    tree = sway.get_tree()
    print(tree)

### Get Focused View

    focused = sway.get_focused_view()
    if focused:
        print(f"Focused View ID: {focused['id']}")
        print(f"Title: {focused.get('name')}")
    

### List All Views

    views = sway.list_views()
    for v in views:
        print(f"ID: {v['id']}, Title: {v['name']}, App ID: {v.get('app_id', 'N/A')}")

### 🎮 Monitor Real-Time Events

Run the built-in event monitor:

    python -m scripts.event_monitor

Or use it in code:

    from scripts.event_monitor import SwayIPC
    
    ipc = SwayIPC()
    ipc.subscribe(["workspace", "window"])  # or ipc.subscribe() to watch all events
    
    while True:
        event = ipc.read_next_event()
        if event:
            print("Event received:", event)
